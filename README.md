# 🌟 Energy Consumption Dashboard Project 📊

Welcome to the "Energy-Consumption-Dashboard-SQL-Excel" repository! This project is a comprehensive endeavor that combines the use of SQL, Excel, and Power Pivot to create an interactive and customized energy consumption dashboard. The dataset used in this project consists of real-world data for energy sources consumption recorded from 11 buildings in the US. 

## Project Overview ℹ️

The main goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface to analyze and visualize energy consumption patterns across different buildings. By leveraging SQL for data retrieval, Excel for data processing, and Power Pivot for data modeling, this dashboard offers a powerful tool for in-depth data analysis and visualization.

## Features ✨

📈 **Data Analysis**: Utilize SQL queries to extract relevant data for analysis.  
📊 **Data Visualization**: Create interactive charts and graphs in Excel to visualize energy consumption trends.  
🔁 **Data Modeling**: Use Power Pivot to create relationships and enhance data modeling capabilities.  
⚙️ **UI Design**: Design a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.  
📑 **ER Diagram**: Explore the entity-relationship diagram for a clear understanding of the database structure.  
🔗 **VBA Integration**: Integrate VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks and enhance functionality.
